    "overview": "The European cloud compliance landscape has undergone a fundamental transformation driven by concerns over US extraterritorial data access laws, particularly the CLOUD Act. Following the Schrems II ruling in 2020, EU organizations face increasing pressure to ensure their data remains protected from foreign government access. France has responded with the most stringent requirements through SecNumCloud 3.2, which effectively bans US hyperscalers from handling government and essential entity data. This has created a tiered compliance landscape where different market segments face vastly different requirements and solution options.",
